When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I have to collaborate with other developers
    When I need to have a backup outside my local mchine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I like pulling changes manually because that way, when I'm working on code,
    it doesn't change without me expecting it.  For example, if I know the new
    version of some code is broken, I might not want to pull that change until I
    the bug is fixed

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks, clones, and branches are all ways to add new changes without
    affecting the existing version.  With branches the new changes are added in
    the same repository.  Forking and cloning both copy an entire repository to
    a new location.  The difference between forking and cloning is that forking
    is a special construct made by GitHub.  You can only fork a GitHub
    repository to another location on GitHub, while you can clone any Git
    repository to anywhere you have access to.

    I use branching for most cases where I want to add new changes to a
    repository while keeping an easy reference to a previous version, especially
    when collaborating with other people.  I clone a repository on GitHub when I
    want to work on that repository locally rather than using the GitHub
    website.  I fork a repository on GitHub when I want to make changes to that
    repository public, but I don't have permission to modify the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
