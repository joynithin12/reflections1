What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - we can choose when to commit 
	Cons - we can committ a lot of changes at once losing the purpose of detailed level tracking

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A single commit can be attributed to a functionality which indicate  many files are logically connected to that commit.
	Google docs does not have the concept of related files hence they dont allow multiple commits

    git log and git diff are the commands

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
